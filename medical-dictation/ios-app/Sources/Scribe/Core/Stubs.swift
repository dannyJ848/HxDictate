// Stubs.swift - DISABLED
// Real C++ bindings are now in Scribe-Bridging-Header.h
// This file is kept for reference but not compiled
// To use stubs instead of real libraries, uncomment below:

/*
// Stub implementations for C functions
// These allow the app to build without linking the actual C++ libraries
// For testing UI only - replace with real implementations for production

import Foundation

// ... (stub implementations)
*/

// Real implementations are linked via the bridging header and static libraries
